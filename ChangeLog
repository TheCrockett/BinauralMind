GENERAL NOTES:
1) All dates here need to be kept in XXXX-YY-ZZ format so they dont' get changed in the mass sed version updates.
2) Version updates are done with these two commands from the root gnaural directory (run ONLY after a virgin CVS download and a "grep -R 20110606 *" to verify no timestamped comments in the source code are affected):
 for i in $(grep -Rl 20110606 *); do sed -i 's/20110606/NewVersionNumberHere/g' "$i"; done
 ./autogen.sh --prefix=/configure
3) My ~/.indent.pro file (used by indent program for my default code formatting):
 -nbad -bap -bbb -bbo -bc -nbfda -bl -bli0 -bls -c0 -ncdb -nce -ci0 -cp1 -cs -di1 -fc1 -nfca -hnl -i1 -ip0 -lp -pcs -nprs -npsl -saf -sai -saw -nsc -sob --no-tabs 

==========================================
2011-02-15:
- completely replaced the contributed code for "Isochronic Pulses"
- added a new voice, "Alt Isochronic Pulses", that alternates the Isochronic pulses between left-right channels 

2010-11-15:
- added Recent Files 
- updated drag'n'drop
- added VU meter

2010-10-06:
-Dragging mouse with Magnetic Pointer selected will "Attract" selected data points on Y-axis to the pointer's position
-There is now a "Graph View" entry in the schedule file so last view is remembered when reopening the file.
-Windows version is now going to carry along it's own GTK DLLs like the Mac one does
-Graph window is now a slidable pane (you can make window bigger or smaller without chaning size of Gnaural)
-Changed (fixed?) Align Data Points to clearer use: now finds first and last selected datapoints in each voice and aligns all other selected datapoints in each voice between them in 

2010-06-02: 
(released as version 1.0.20100528)
-Added both read and write OGG support (the opensource MP3 equivalent)
-Added ability for Linux distros to provide library download, see:
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3002560&group_id=149086&atid=773669
-updated the libsnd library for Windows
-Added Mono output button
-Fixed the About link so it now opens browsers on most platforms
-Cleaned up a lot of the audio format handling code

2009-12-15:
-bunch of gettextize stuff

2009-08-08:
-Changed portaudio buffer sizes so there is no more stuttering in Vista and it also happily compiles to Mac's tiny buffer size
-Added "Isochronic Pulses" as a pure patch provided by a user, did no more tinkering to it as it a) worked and b) was remarkably uninvasive in the overall Gnaural concept (which is Binaural Beat).
-Added a couple Tools menu items.
-Fixed the Anjuta project file to work with newer Anjuta versions, even though i seem to be a die-hard Geany user now.
-Came up with a link line to static-link enough unusual libs that i can run Gnaural as a standalone executable (with gnaural.glade, of course) on Puppy Linux. this is the line:
gcc -g -O2  -Wl,-export-dynamic -o gnaural main.o BinauralBeat.o ScheduleGUI.o ScheduleXML.o support.o callbacks.o exportAudio.o voiceGUI.o playAudio.o gnauralnet_main.o gnauralnet_lists.o gnauralnet_clocksync.o gnauralnet_socket.o gnauralnet_running.o gnauralnet_gui.o /usr/lib/libgio-2.0.a /usr/lib/libportaudio.a /usr/lib/libjack.a -pthread -lglade-2.0 -lgtk-x11-2.0 -lxml2 -lgdk-x11-2.0 -latk-1.0 -lpangoft2-1.0 -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0 -lpangocairo-1.0 -lcairo -lpango-1.0 -lfreetype -lfontconfig -lgobject-2.0 -lgmodule-2.0 -lgthread-2.0 -lrt -lglib-2.0 -lsndfile -lasound -lm -lpthread

2008-08-08:
-Apparently i skipped an entire year of updating here :) Fact is, 20080808  was the first real "version 1" release, and after a few tense of thousands of downloads still never got any bugs filed on it (even though i found a few - stuttering in Vista, mainly, platform requirements conflicts). So it was a good year, now on to 20090808 (above).

2008-02-25b9:
-Expected to be the last version using PortAudio v18; next will use PortAudio v19 to be MacOSX compatible.
-To prepare for above, all PortAudio code was segreated in to a pair of playAudio.c/h files. 
-Also, these files are now linked with the poraudio library (instead of literally making my own object files). 
 FOR THE RECORD, I compiled the current Win32 version using the v18 snapshop, which had a couple 
 minor errors in it -- specifically, mingw-gcc complained that two functions weren't declared "static."
 Apparently, I don't need a DLL, I only need the libportaudio.a and portaudio.h files (the . I am going on-and
 on here about it because it is very confusing having two portaudios (v18 and v19) that sometimes use the 
 same named libs and sometimes don't.
-Now user can click on the progress bar to move to that point in the schedule.
-Added rule that any gnauralnet participant that does FF/RW/STOP/PAUSE/engine-reload gets seniority docked

2008-02-25b8:
-First version with elementary networking (e.g., "GnauralNet"). It doesn't look 
 like much, perhaps, but inside is the groundwork for some pretty ambitious plans.
 Currently, in theory, any number of Gnaurals can connect to each other; but for
 now, they don't share schedules (or even particular check that different Gnaurals are
 running the same schedule) -- but for people using the default internal one, it is an 
 interesting way to, say, get 250 people exactly in the same wavelength (if you're 
 trying for world peace or such). I've finally decided to release it as-is (even knowing 
 there will be big changes soon) because the direction it goes depends on what people
 actually want to use; and continuing to code without that sense is sure to be a waste.

2007-07-07:
- Lots of new tools, select options, edit functions. Basically, it is full-fledged now
  20070b2B3 BUGFIXES:
   -fixed the BB_SeedRand happening with same numbers every BB_InitVoices
  20070b2B3 BUGFIXES:
   -made engine more efficient
   -implemented thread-safety booleans BB_PauseFlag and BB_InCriticalLoopFlag to avoid "data-nulled" segfaults 
  20070b2B2 BUGFIXES:
   -found a simple but bad bug in SG_ConvertYToData_SelectedPoints that was making balances below middle line diminish with changes in volume graph.
   -discovered and fixed a massive memory leak in BB (wasn't cleaning voices before init'ing because voicecount was zero'd before cleaning)
   -changed BB's find-current-datapoint routine to remember last known one (large DP counts would slow it down to a crawl). Unfortunately, this introduced a ton on new bugs, but was necessary
  
2007-06-20:
- implemented Undo/Redo (only goes back one step)
- implemented basic handling Voice Description strings

TODO:
- Algorithms under Tools/Select/Edit menu:
  - [Tools] Scale schedule duration to an exact time
  - [Tools] Y-axis "Smooth" selected DPs 
  - [Tools] Invert Voice
  - [Tools] Select by Duration
  - [Edit] Paste to end
  - [Select] All points below given duration
- In opening files, don't let discrepancy between <totalentrycount> and real total entry count wreck the read (easy, just work to read twice)
- In the main_VoicePropertiesDialog, give some info about the voice (number of DPs, etc.)
- In "add random duration" it can only make schedules longer, because it doesn't subtract from point before; lousy feature, change
- In "add random Y" it bottoms out on the bottom because it can't go below zero; might want to use some sort of algo
