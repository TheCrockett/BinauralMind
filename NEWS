Gnaural

20080225b8:
-First version with elementary networking (e.g., "GnauralNet"). It doesn't look 
  like much, perhaps, but inside is the groundwork for some pretty ambitious plans.
  Currently, in theory, any number of Gnaurals can connect to each other; but for
  now, they don't share schedules (or even particular check that different Gnaurals are
  running the same schedule) -- but for people using the default internal one, it is an 
  interesting way to, say, get 250 people exactly in the same wavelength (if you're 
  trying for world peace or such). I've finally decided to release it as-is (even knowing 
  there will be big changes soon) because the direction it goes depends on what people
  actually want to use; and continuing to code without that sense is sure to be a waste.
